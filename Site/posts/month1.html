                <p>
                    This week I began my trading journey with a starting balance of one thousand dollars and ended the week with a balance of one thousand seven hundred dollars while trading the Nasdaq. The growth came from a consistent application of Exponential Moving Average concepts, which gave me a structured way to evaluate the market and time my trades.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The EMA helped me identify both the short term and long term trends. By using shorter periods, such as the nine and twenty one EMAs, I was able to capture momentum shifts more quickly, while the longer EMA, such as the fifty or two hundred, confirmed whether the overall market was trending upward or downward. This combination allowed me to avoid trading against the broader move.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Crossovers between these averages provided clear entry and exit signals. When the shorter EMA crossed above the longer EMA, it suggested a strong upward move, and when it crossed below, it indicated weakening momentum. I also noticed that prices often respected the EMA lines themselves, almost as if they acted as dynamic support or resistance zones. This gave me confidence in where to place stop losses and where to take profits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another important observation was discipline. Rather than chasing trades when price moved too far away from the EMA, I waited for the market to pull back closer to those levels. This reduced unnecessary risk and prevented emotional decisions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The results show how valuable EMA strategies can be. In just one week, I grew my account by seventy percent. More importantly, I learned how to use EMA not only as a technical tool but also as a guide for patience and consistency in the fast moving Nasdaq market. This weekâ€™s experience reinforces my plan to continue refining these methods in order to build a stronger foundation for long term trading success.
